@article{Hudetz:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Consciousness is thought to scale with brain complexity, and it may be diminished in anesthesia. Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) of field potentials has been shown to be a promising measure of the level of consciousness in anesthetized human subjects, neurological patients, and across the sleep-wake states in rats. Whether this relationship holds for intrinsic networks obtained by functional brain imaging has not been tested. To fill this gap of knowledge, we estimated LZC from large-scale dynamic analysis of functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) in conscious sedated and unconscious anesthetized rats. Blood oxygen dependent (BOLD) signals were obtained from 30-min whole-brain resting-state scans while the anesthetic propofol was infused intravenously at constant infusion rates of 20 mg/kg/h (conscious sedated) and 40 mg/kg/h (unconscious). Dynamic brain networks were defined at voxel level by sliding window analysis of regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the BOLD signal. From scans performed at low to high propofol dose, the LZC was significantly reduced by 110%. The results suggest that the difference in LZC between conscious sedated and anesthetized unconscious subjects is conserved in rats and this effect is detectable in large-scale brain network obtained from fMRI.},

Much of perception, learning and high-level cognition involves finding patterns in data. But there are always infinitely many patterns compatible with any finite amount of data. How does the cognitive system choose `sensible' patterns? A long tradition in epistemology, philosophy of science, and mathematical and computational theories of learning argues that patterns `should' be chosen according to how simply they explain the data. This article reviews research exploring the idea that simplicity does, indeed, drive a wide range of cognitive processes. We outline mathematical theory, computational results, and empirical data underpinning this viewpoint.},

	Abstract = {The capacity for abstraction is vital for adaptive behavior. Based on behavioral data and event-related 
potentials (ERPs), the present study investigates the brain's ability to encode abstract auditory rules with 
a dynamic approach in which rules constantly emerge and vanish. In successive conditions, abstract rules 
are task-irrelevant and task-relevant. Results show that as few as two consecutive exemplars of an 
abstract feature (frequency relation between successive tones) are sufficient for rule extraction. The 
extraction of just emerging rules is independent of the amount of attention devoted to the rules, and it is 
not modulated by further rule-conforming exemplars. The extracted rules are immediately applied, as 
evidenced by the interference of task-irrelevant rule violations with concurrent mental processes 
(distraction condition) and by the conscious detection of task-relevant violations (detection condition). 
The ability to rapidly encode abstract rules and to detect presumably important rule-violating events 
underlines the brain's adaptability to the environmental demands. },

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a frontal negative 
deflection in the human event-related potential that typi- 
cally occurs when a repeating auditory stimulus changes 
in some manner. The MMN can be elicited by many 
kinds of stimulus change, varying from simple changes 
in a single stimulus feature to abstract changes in the 
relationship between stimuli. The main intracerebral 
sources for the MMN are located in the auditory cortices 
of the temporal lobe. Since it occurs whether or not stim- 
uli are being attended, the MMN represents an automatic 
cerebral process for detecting change. The MMN is clini- 
cally helpful in terms of demonstrating disordered sen- 
sory processing or disordered memory in groups of 
patients. Improvements in the techniques for measuring 
the MMN and in the paradigms for eliciting it will be 
needed before the MMN can become clinically useful as 
an objective measurement of such disorders in individu- 
al patients.  },

	Abstract = {Abstract. The human sequential grouping that organizes 
parts of tones into a group was examined by the mismatch 
negativity (MMN), a component of event-related poten- 
tials that reveals the sensory memory process. The sequen- 
tial grouping is accomplished by the combinations of some 
factors, e.g., temporal and frequency proximity principles. 
In this study, auditory oddball stimuli in which each of the 
stimuli consisted of series of tone bursts, were applied to 
the subjects, and the MMN elicited by the deviation of 
the frequency of the last tone in the stimulus was investi- 
gated. The relationship between the expected phenomena 
of sequential grouping of tones and observed magnitudes 
of MMN was evaluated. It was shown that the magnitudes 
of MMN changed according to the configuration (num- 
ber of tones, frequency) of tone sequence to be stored. 
This result suggested that the sequential grouping of pre- 
sented tones was achieved on the preattentive auditory 
sensory memory process. It was also shown that the rel- 
ative change of MMN magnitudes corresponded to the 
conditions of sequential grouping, which had been pro- 
posed by the auditory psychophysical studies. The inves- 
tigation of MMN properties could reveal the nature of 
auditory sequential grouping. },

@article{Slater:2009aa,
	Abstract = {In this paper address we the question as to why participants tend to respond realistically 
to situations and events portrayed within an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) system.  
The idea is put forward, based on experience of a large number of experimental studies, 
that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The 
first is `being there', often called `presence', the qualia of having a sensation of being in a 
real place. We call this Place Illusion (PI). Second, Plausibility Illusion (Psi) refers to the 
illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and 
Psi the participant knows for sure that that they are not `there' and that the events are not 
occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual 
reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events 
that directly relate to the participant, and the overall credibility of the scenario being 
depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, 
participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.
